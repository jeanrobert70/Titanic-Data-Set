# This is the legendary Titanic ML competition.

The competition is simple: Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I developed a ML model that predicts the answer to the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
