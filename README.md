# This is the legendary Titanic ML competition.

The competition is simple: Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I developed a ML model that predicts the answer to this question: “What sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). I fell that working the titanic dataset is a 'right of passage' for aspiring machine learning engineers and I hope you learn somethng new or reminded of something old from my rendition of it. Cheers!
